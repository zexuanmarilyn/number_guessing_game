## Number Guessing Game

- the purpose of the code is to generate the game logic for the number guessing game

### Rules of the game:
- the program selects a number between 1 - 100
- the player is to guess the number selected
- if a wrong selection is made, the program will prompt the user as to whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the actual number
- the game ends when the player has guessed the selected number



This is just a simple game with a straightforward logic. I developed this so as to practice my Python skills.
